          The First Things First manifesto was written 29 November 1963 and
          published in 1964 by Ken Garland. It was backed by over 400 graphic
          designers and artists and also received the backing of Tony Benn,
          radical left-wing MP and activist, who published it in its entirety in
          The Guardian newspaper.

          Reacting against a rich and affluent Britain of the 1960s, it tried to
          re-radicalise a design industry which the signatories felt had become
          lazy and uncritical. Drawing on ideas shared by critical theory, the
          Frankfurt School, and the counter-culture of the time, it explicitly
          reaffirmed the belief that design is not a neutral, value-free
          process.

          It rallied against the consumerist culture that was purely concerned
          with buying and selling things and tried to highlight a Humanist
          dimension to graphic design theory. It was later updated and
          republished with a new group of signatories as the First Things First
          2000 manifesto.
