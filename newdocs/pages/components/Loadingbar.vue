            In 2015, fifteen years after a global cataclysm known as the Second
            Impact, teenager Shinji Ikari is summoned to the futuristic city of
            Tokyo-3 by his estranged father Gendo Ikari, director of the special
            paramilitary force Nerv. Shinji witnesses United Nations forces
            battling an Angel, one of a race of giant monstrous beings whose
            awakening was foretold by the Dead Sea Scrolls. Because of the
            Angels' near-impenetrable force-fields, Nerv's giant Evangelion
            bio-machines, synchronized to the nervous systems of their pilots
            and possessing their own force-fields, are the only weapons capable
            of keeping the Angels from annihilating humanity. Nerv officer
            Misato Katsuragi escorts Shinji into the Nerv complex beneath the
            city, where his father pressures him into piloting the Evangelion
            Unit-01 against the Angel. Without training, Shinji is quickly
            overwhelmed in the battle, causing the Evangelion to go berserk and
            savagely kill the Angel on its own. Following hospitalization,
            Shinji moves in with Misato and settles into life in Tokyo-3. In his
            second battle, Shinji destroys an Angel but runs away afterward,
            distraught. Misato confronts Shinji and he decides to remain a
            pilot. The Nerv crew and Shinji must then battle and defeat the
            remaining fourteen Angels to prevent the Third Impact, a global
            cataclysm that would destroy the world. Evangelion Unit-00 is
            repaired shortly afterward. Shinji tries to befriend its pilot, the
            mysterious, socially isolated teenage girl Rei Ayanami. With Rei's
            help, Shinji defeats another Angel. They are then joined by the
            pilot of Evangelion Unit-02, the multitalented but insufferable
            teenager Asuka Langley S≈çryu, who is German-Japanese-American.
            Together, the three of them manage to defeat several Angels. As
            Shinji adjusts to his new role as a pilot, he gradually becomes more
            confident and self-assured. Asuka moves in with Shinji, and they
            begin to develop confusing feelings for one another, kissing at her
            provocation. After being absorbed by an Angel, Shinji breaks free
            thanks to Eva acting on its own. He is later forced to fight an
            infected Evangelion Unit-03 and watches its pilot, his friend and
            classmate Toji Suzuhara, become incapacitated and permanently
            disabled. Asuka loses her self-confidence following a defeat and
            spirals into depression. This is worsened by her next fight, against
            an Angel which attacks her mind and forces her to relive her worst
            fears and childhood trauma, resulting in a mental breakdown. In the
            next battle, Rei self-destructs Unit-00 and dies to save Shinji's
            life. Misato and Shinji visit the hospital where they find Rei alive
            but claiming she is "the third Rei". Misato forces scientist Ritsuko
            Akagi to reveal the dark secrets of Nerv, the Evangelion boneyard,
            and the dummy plug system which operates using clones of Rei, who
            was herself created with the DNA of Shinji's mother, Yui Ikari. This
            succession of events leaves Shinji emotionally scarred and alienated
            from the rest of the characters. Kaworu Nagisa replaces the
            catatonic Asuka as the pilot of Unit-02. Kaworu, who initially
            befriends Shinji and gains his trust, is in truth the final foretold
            Angel, Tabris. Kaworu fights Shinji, then realizes that he must die
            if humanity is to survive and asks Shinji to kill him. Shinji
            hesitates but eventually kills Kaworu; the event makes Shinji
            overridden with guilt. After the final Angel is defeated, Seele, the
            mysterious cabal overseeing the events of the series, triggers the
            "Human Instrumentality Project", a forced evolution of humanity in
            which the souls of all mankind are merged for benevolent purposes,
            believing that if unified, humanity could finally overcome the
            loneliness and alienation that has eternally plagued mankind.
            Shinji's soul grapples with the reason for his existence and reaches
            an epiphany that he needs others to thrive, enabling him to destroy
            the wall of negative emotions that torment him and reunite with the
            others, who congratulate him.
