              in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury,

              and the location at which the material appeared before it was
              removed or disabled; (2) a statement that you consent to the
              jurisdiction of the Federal District Court in which your address

              any judicial district in which we are located; (3) a statement

              such party has filed a court action to restrain you from engaging
              in infringing activity related to the material in question. Please
              note that if you materially misrepresent that the disabled or
              removed content was removed by mistake or misidentification, you
              may be liable for damages, including costs and attorney’s fees.
              Filing a false Counter Notification constitutes perjury.

              maintain and support the Site or to supply any corrections,
              updates, or releases in connection therewith. GOVERNING LAW These
              Terms of Service and your use of the Site are governed by and
              construed in accordance with the laws of the State of [name of
              state] applicable to agreements made and to be entirely performed
              within the State/Commonwealth of [name of state], without regard
              to its conflict of law principles. DISPUTE RESOLUTION Option 1:
              Any legal action of whatever nature brought by either you or us
              (collectively, the “Parties” and individually, a “Party”) shall be
              commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal courts located in
              [name of county] County, [name of state], and the Parties hereby
              consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal
              jurisdiction and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and
              jurisdiction in such state and federal courts. Application of the
              United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale
              of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act
              (UCITA) are excluded from these Terms of Service. In no event
              shall any claim, action, or proceeding brought by either Party
              related in any way to the Site be commenced more than ______ years
              after the cause of action arose. Option 2: Informal Negotiations
              To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute,
              controversy, or claim related to these Terms of Service (each a
              “Dispute” and collectively, the “Disputes”) brought by either you
              or us (individually, a “Party” and collectively, the “Parties”),
              the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute
              (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at
              least ______ days before initiating arbitration. Such informal
              negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the
              other Party. Binding Arbitration If the Parties are unable to
              resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute
              (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) will be finally
              and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND
              THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN
              COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be commenced
              and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the
              American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and, where appropriate,
              the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes
              (“AAA Consumer Rules”), both of which are available at the AAA
              website www.adr.org. Your arbitration fees and your share of
              arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer
              Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules.
              [If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive,
              we will pay all arbitration fees and expenses.] The arbitration
              may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents,
              by phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in
              writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless
              requested by either Party. The arbitrator must follow applicable
              law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do
              so. Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or
              applicable law, the arbitration will take place in [name of
              county] County, [name of state]. Except as otherwise provided
              herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration,
              stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify,
              vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.
              If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than
              arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the
              state and federal courts located in [name of county] County, [name
              of state], and the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all
              defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non
              conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state
              and federal courts. Application of the United Nations Convention
              on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the the
              Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) are excluded
              from these Terms of Service. In no event shall any Dispute brought
              by either Party related in any way to the Site be commenced more
              than _____ years after the cause of action arose. If this
              provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither
              Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that
              portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and
              such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction
              within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties
              agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court. Option
              3: Binding Arbitration To expedite resolution and control the cost
              of any dispute, controversy or claim related to these Terms of
              Service (each a “Dispute” and collectively, “Disputes”), any
              Dispute brought by either you or us (individually, a “Party” and
              collectively, the “Parties”) shall be finally and exclusively
              resolved by binding arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS
              PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A
              JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under
              the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
              Association (“AAA”) and, where appropriate, the AAA’s
              Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“AAA
              Consumer Rules”), both of which are available at the AAA website
              www.adr.org. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator
              compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and,
              where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. [If such
              costs are determined to by the arbitrator to be excessive, we will
              pay all arbitration fees and expenses.] The arbitration may be
              conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by
              phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing,
              but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by
              either Party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any
              award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except
              where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable
              law, the arbitration will take place in [name of county] County,
              [name of state]. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties
              may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings
              pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter
              judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator. If for any
              reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the
              Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal
              courts located in [name of county] County, [name of state], and
              the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of,
              personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect to
              venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts.
              Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
              International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information
              Transaction Act (UCITA) are excluded from these Terms of Service.
              In no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in
              any way to the Site or Services be commenced more than ______
              years after the cause of action arose. If this provision is found
              to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to
              arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this
              provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute
              shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the
              courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to
              submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court. Option 2/Option
              3: Restrictions The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be
              limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually. To the
              full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined
              with any other proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for
              any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize
              class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority
              for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative
              capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.
              Option 2/Option 3: Exceptions to [Informal Negotiations and]
              Arbitration The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not
              subject to the above provisions concerning [informal negotiations
              and] binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or
              protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual
              property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising
              from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or
              unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this
              provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither
              Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that
              portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and
              such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction
              within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties
              agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.

              and us. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision
              of these Terms of Service shall not operate as a waiver of such
              right or provision. These Terms of Service operate to the fullest
              extent permissible by law. We may assign any or all of our rights
              and obligations to others at any time. We shall not be responsible

              of a provision of these Terms of Service is determined to be
              unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision or part of the
              provision is deemed severable from these Terms of Service and does
              not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining
              provisions. There is no joint venture, partnership, employment or
              agency relationship created between you and us as a result of
              these Terms of Service or use of the Site. You agree that these
              Terms of Service will not be construed against us by virtue of
              having drafted them. You hereby waive any and all defenses you may
              have based on the electronic form of these Terms of Service and
              the lack of signing by the parties hereto to execute these Terms
              of Service. CONTACT US In order to resolve a complaint regarding
